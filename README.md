VR Movement and Interactions

Movement: 
I chose to go with smooth locomotion using the forward direction with the joystick.  I am not a fan of teleportation in most experiences.  Sometimes it is needed depending on the game type, but I believe to be fully immersed I have to be able to move like I do in real life and sadly I cannot teleport.  

Interactions:
I input a desk to show the opening and closing of drawers
A telephone you can pick up and depending on where you put the receiver changes the sound volume
When you pick up my “Seizure Cube” it begins changing colors based off an array (tried to input custom mapping so it would only change when you pressed a button but I could not get it to work, so the Seizure Cube was born.

A button UI was added 

Prototype Requirements:
-One SteamVR-enabled interaction:
 The Desk drawers are opened and closed using a linear drive 
-At least one needs to implement a custom mapping for controller input
Cube was supposed to do this
-At least one interaction that mimics a physical-world interaction
-An advanced or abstract interaction 
Picking up the phone in my opinion covers the real word interaction and an advanced interaction
-There must be one menu interaction 
A button above the Seizure Cube will scroll through its colors one at a time.
